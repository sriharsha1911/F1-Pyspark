Data warehouse:
they can process structured,semistructured but not unstructured
 Data sources ->           ETL -> Data Marts -> Data Consumers (Analytics)
 (struc,semi struc)
 
 Drwbacks: 
 no support for unstruc data.
 takes more time to get data loaded to dw because transformation tak befor loading
 difficult to scale on prem dws
 lack of suppoet of ds,ml,ai
 
 
 Data lake:                                        transfoem
 Source    ->            -----> Data lake          ---->    Data lakes
  (struc,semi,un struc)         (HDFS,S#, ADLS)                 |
                                                                |
                                                                Ai, ml
 Drawbacks:
 too slow to serve Bi reports.
 to make it fast data is moved from Datalakes to datamarts which made the architecture complex
 . No support for ACID trnsactions
 failed job leave partil fails
 inconsistent reads
 cannot edit, we have to drop table or partition
 no history or  versioning
 difficult to combine batch and streaming work loads
 
 Delta lake: is a Data lake with acid properties
 due to acid properties we can combine streaming abd batch workloads
 
 adv:
 att types of data
 supports bi,ai, ml workloads
 support acid
 no need of lambda architectutre for combining batch and sreaming
 
 
 when storing a sparquet files delta lake also creates transaction log through which acid properties ,history ,versioimhg can be achieved
